    # Create a template where one codon will be mutated to an 'X' codon
    # Original: AAA CCC GGG (K P G)
    # We want to mutate CCC (1,1,1) to TAA (3,0,0) which is an 'X'
    # To do this, we need to carefully craft the `particles_template_batch`
    # and the `key` so that the mutation results in TAA.

    # Let's simplify: create a template and a proposed mutation that *would* result in X
    # and ensure it's reverted.

    # Template: AAA CCC GGG
    template = jnp.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], dtype=jnp.int32).reshape(1, -1)

    # We want to simulate a mutation that changes CCC (1,1,1) to TAA (3,0,0)
    # This means the offsets for the second codon should be:
    # 1 -> 3 (offset +2)
    # 1 -> 0 (offset -1 or +3 mod 4)
    # 1 -> 0 (offset -1 or +3 mod 4)

    # This is hard to control with `random.randint` directly.
    # A better approach for this specific test is to mock the internal `lax.dynamic_slice_in_dim`
    # or `CODON_INT_TO_RES_INT_JAX` lookup, but that's beyond simple unit testing.

    # Alternative: Create a scenario where a mutation *would* create an X,
    # and verify the original codon is retained.

    # Let's manually construct a `particles_with_all_proposed_mutations`
    # that has an 'X' codon and pass it to a simplified version of the function
    # or test the `check_and_revert_x_codons_single_particle` directly.

    # Since `initial_mutation_kernel_no_x_jax` is a jit-compiled function,
    # mocking internal JAX calls is not straightforward.
    # We will rely on the `vmap` and `lax` operations behaving as expected.

    # Let's create a template and a `mu_nuc` that will cause an 'X' codon
    # with a specific random key.
    # This requires some trial and error with JAX's PRNG.

    # For example, if we have a codon (0,0,0) -> K
    # And we want to mutate it to (3,0,0) -> X (TAA)
    # This means the offsets should be:
    # 0 -> 3 (offset +3)
    # 0 -> 0 (offset +0)
    # 0 -> 0 (offset +0)

    # Let's try to find a key that produces these offsets for the first codon.
    # This is not ideal for a robust test, but demonstrates the concept.

    # to TAA (3,0,0) which is an 'X' codon.

    # A better way would be to pass pre-computed `mutation_mask_attempt` and `offsets`
    # if the function allowed it, or to test the inner `check_and_revert_x_codons_single_particle`
    # directly if it were not `vmap`ped.
