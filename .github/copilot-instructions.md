This project is a Python codebase converted from a single Jupyter cell. It uses JAX, numpy, scipy, pyarrow, colabdesign, and other scientific libraries. Please ensure all code is modular, well-documented, and compatible with ruff linting. Place main experiment logic in a script or module under src/ and provide a CLI entry point if possible.
